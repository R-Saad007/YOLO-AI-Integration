## This script produces a JSON file containing the class name, bounding box coordinates and the probabilities of a predicted object inside an image. The JSON file can be fed to the front-end for further processing.

### You will have to provide the image and model weight file path to the script before executing it:
```python yolov8_coordinate_parser.py -img_path (enter the image path) -model_path  (enter the model weight file path)```
