# This is the script for obtaining the bounding box coordinates for an object detected inside an image.

### You will have to provide the **image path** to the script before executing it:
```python yolov8_coordinate_parser.py -img_path (enter the image path)```

### I have already provided the weight file for the yolov8n model we trained (best.pt), hence no need to invoke the argument for the model_path. I have commented it out as well.
