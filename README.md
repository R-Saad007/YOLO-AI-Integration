# This script produces a JSON file containing the class name, bounding box coordinates and the probabilities of a predicted object inside a frame. The JSON file can be fed to the front-end for further processing.

### You will have to provide the **image path** to the script before executing it:
```python yolov8_coordinate_parser.py -img_path (enter the image path)```

### I have already provided the weight file for the yolov8n model trained (best.pt), hence no need to invoke the argument for the model_path.
